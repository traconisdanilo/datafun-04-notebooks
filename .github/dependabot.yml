# REQ.PROJECT: This repository SHOULD track GitHub Actions updates automatically.
# WHY-FILE: GitHub Actions are executable dependencies and may receive security or behavior updates.
# OBS: Language-level dependencies (e.g., Python packages) are upgraded manually.
# OBS: GitHub Actions are the only dependency class automated here.
# ALT: Dependabot could be omitted if workflows are pinned and reviewed manually.
# CUSTOM: Update interval if CI cadence or security posture changes.

# NOTE: This file automatically updates the versions used in Actions workflows.
# You don't need to modify this file.
# To disable: Delete this file or set enabled: false below.
# enabled: false # Uncomment to disable Dependabot
