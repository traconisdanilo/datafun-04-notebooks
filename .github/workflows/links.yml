# WHY-FILE: Automated link checking.
# OBS: Behavior is configured in lychee.toml in this repository.
# OBS: Runs on pull requests and monthly on schedule; manual trigger always available.
# OBS: This workflow always publishes a report table to the job summary.
# OBS: This workflow marks the run as failed (not green) when broken links are found.

          If the link checker reports a 404 for the Dependabot security page, it is often because Advanced Security options are not enabled.

          Please go to:
          Repository Settings -> Advanced Security

          Enable at least:
          - Dependabot security updates
          - Grouped security updates (recommended)

          After enabling, the Dependabot security page link should resolve.
