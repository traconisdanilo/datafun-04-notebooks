# Penguins CSV

Alternative: Load from CSV file instead of seaborn.

Download penguins.csv from: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv>

Save it to project data/raw folder.

NOTE: The CSV file is not exactly the same as the Seaborn version.
- CSV includes a `year` column (2007, 2008, 2009)
- Seaborn version does not include `year`

It is included here for visual inspection and/or opening in Excel as you like.
