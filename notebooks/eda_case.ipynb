    "Here are a few tips to help you get started with Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To run a cell, press **Ctrl+Enter** (or **Cmd+Enter** on Mac) when you're done editing the cell.\n",
    "- You can change the type of a cell (e.g., code or markdown) by looking in the lower left corner of the notebook interface.\n",
    "- You can rearrange cells by dragging and dropping them within the notebook.\n",
    "- After creating a new notebook, use **File > Save as** to rename and save it into your repository folder.\n",
    "- To select a kernel (Python environment) for your notebook in Visual Studio Code, click on the **Select Kernel** name in the top-right corner of the notebook interface and choose the desired kernel from the dropdown menu. Follow suggestions to install recommended extensions. Once installed, click Select Kernel / Python Environments and choose the Recommended `.venv` option we created earlier. This will create a new kernel for the notebook and allow you to run code in the notebook using the packages installed in the virtual environment.\n",
